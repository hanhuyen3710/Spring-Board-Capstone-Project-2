Capstone Project 2: Credit Card Approval with LGB

Data set from UC Irvine can be obtained [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval).

Problem statement: Credit Card Approval Prediction helps many people with their financial planning from paying tuition, business to everyday purchase. Credit Score affects someone's life, and an approved credit card can help them tremendously. At the same time, many cannot pay off the debt and the bank ends up paying. A great machine learning model to help decide the credit card approval can not only save time but money for individuals and financial institutes. Hence we try to improve the old machines with the newest LGB here.

My Jupiter notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/hanhuyen3710/Spring-Board-Capstone-Project-2/blob/master/Capstone%20Project%202%20Credit%20Card%20Approval%20Prediction.ipynb).

Milestone report is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zGlBkhTMD86euCpwgBKb3aah32Pejs84zJjc_cUccKs/edit?usp=sharing).

Still need to work on the slide-deck and final report.
